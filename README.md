Publication:
This repository serves as a companion to the "Evaluation of epistasis detection methods for quantitative phenotypes" publication by Stanislav Listopad, Gauri Renjith, and Qian Peng.

Inputs:
All of the input simulated data used in the study is contained within the Epigen_Datasets folder. 
The datasets in Epigen_Datasets have already been formatted for the tools included in the study. 
The adolescent brain cognitive development (ABCD) data used in the study can only be obtained by requesting access from national institute of mental health (NIMH):
https://nda.nih.gov/abcd/request-access

Further information regarding the simulated datasets can be found in main text and supplemental (supplemental file S1) of our publication.

Software:
The individual epistasis detection tools used in the study can be found online: \n
EpiSNP: https://animalgene.umn.edu/episnp \n
Matrix Epistasis: https://github.com/fanglab/MatrixEpistasis \n
MIDESP: https://github.com/FelixHeinrich/MIDESP \n
PLINK Epistasis / BOOST: https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/ \n
QMDR / MDR: https://sourceforge.net/projects/mdr/files/ \n
REMMA: https://github.com/chaoning/REMMA \n

Further information on runtime configuration for each tool can be found in main text and supplemental (supplemental file S2).

Expected Output:
The Epigen_Analysis_Results folder contains the outputs generated when evaluating all of the included software on Epigen simulated datasets. 
The results of analyzing ABCD data using selected tools are summarized within publication.
