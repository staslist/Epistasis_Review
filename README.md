Publication:  
This repository serves as a companion to the "Evaluation of epistasis detection methods for quantitative phenotypes" publication by Stanislav Listopad, Gauri Renjith, and Qian Peng.  

Inputs:  
All of the input simulated data used in the study is contained within the EpiGEN_Datasets folder. 
The datasets in EpiGEN_Datasets have already been formatted for the tools included in the study. 
The adolescent brain cognitive development (ABCD) data used in the study can only be obtained by requesting access from national institute of mental health (NIMH):
https://nda.nih.gov/abcd/request-access  

Further information regarding the simulated datasets can be found in publication and within the (EpiGEN_Dataset_Specifications.docx) file in the repository.

Software:  
The individual epistasis detection tools used in the study can be found online:  
EpiSNP: https://animalgene.umn.edu/episnp  
Matrix Epistasis: https://github.com/fanglab/MatrixEpistasis  
MIDESP: https://github.com/FelixHeinrich/MIDESP  
PLINK Epistasis / BOOST: https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/  
QMDR / MDR: https://sourceforge.net/projects/mdr/files/  
REMMA: https://github.com/chaoning/REMMA  

Further information on runtime configuration for each tool can be found in publication and (Input_Data_Formats.docx) file in the repository.

Majority of the code used to format JSONs generated by EpiGEN into appropriate format for each tool can be found in the process_epigen_simulated_data.py file in the repository. 

Expected Output:  
The Epigen_Analysis_Results folder contains the outputs generated when evaluating all of the included software on EpiGEN simulated datasets.  
The results of analyzing ABCD data using selected tools are summarized within publication.
