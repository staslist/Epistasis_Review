Ready to use tools:

Conditions for use: SNP to SNP analysis, Supports Continous Phenotype, Well Documented, Easy to Install and Use, Runtime Efficiency (analyze 1000 individuals x 1000 SNPs < 60 minutes)
Additionally, let us include 2-3 case-control tools with discretized phenotype. 

Matrix Epistasis (Linear Regression) - EVALUATED
MIDESP (Mutual Information) - EVALUATED
Plink (Linear Regression) - EVALUATED
QMDR (MDR) - EVALUATED (MEETS ALL CONDITIONS)
EpiSNP (general linear model) - EVALUATED (check runtime efficiency)

Plink (BOOST - DISCRETIZED) - EVALUATED
QMDR or MDR (MDR - DISCRETIZED) - EVALUATED

GMDR (MDR) - VIABLE, BUT SIMILAR PERFORMANCE TO QMDR
SNPassoc (log likelihoood ratio test?) - VIABLE, BUT INCONVENIENT TO USE AND PRONE TO ERRORS - VERY SLOW RUNTIME (>>1hour for 1000 SNPs) - executes in few minutes if NUMBER OF SNPs TO TEST <100
WISH-R (Pre-Filtering + Linear Regression) - FAILED INSTALLATION - CAN BE USED AS INSPIRATION FOR PRE (FILTERING) and POST (NETWORK ANALYSIS) STEPS
FastANOVA (ANOVA) - FAILED INSTALLATION - COULD USE PUBLICATION AND SOURCE CODE TO RE-IMPLEMENT

Outlined Methods:
Combinatorial Partitioning
QMDR, GMDR
LASSO
SCAD
MUSE
Gene-based gene-gene interaction (GGG) tests

Proposed Methods:
Random Forest (extended for quantitative phenotype)
Notably, authors of many epistasis detection methods for binary case-control phenotype claim that their methods can 
be extended to quantitative phenotypes. 
Additionally, I have seen at least one case of authors discretizing their phenotype (ex: BMI) into case-control setup.

Possbile Filters:
Domain-based hypothesis
Protein-protein Interactions
Pathways
Marginal Epistasis
GWAS
